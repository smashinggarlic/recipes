# Desi Chai (for 1 person)



## Ingredients

- Whole Milk
- water
- chai powder



## Steps to make the batter

 1. In a pot, add some water and 1 tbsp of chai powder and let it simmer for a few mins (like 5 mins on low heat).
    - optional: add cardamom (Elaichi) powder for additional taste.
 3. Add one mug of milk (the mug in which you will be eventually drinking in) and put it on low heat
 4. Add sugar to this, watch it like a hawk & let it come to a boil (on low to medium heat). Patience is the key, a good tea takes time (it takes 10-15 mins for me)
 5. The color should be nice caramelized brown
