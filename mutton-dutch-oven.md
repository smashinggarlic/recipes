## Telangana Mutton Curry (Dutch Oven & Oven)

This recipe brings you a delicious Telangana mutton curry traditionally made in a pressure cooker, but transformed for a Dutch oven and oven finish, resulting in deep flavors and tender meat.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 kg mutton, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 4 tbsp cooking oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 inch ginger, grated
* 2 green chilies, chopped (adjust based on spice tolerance)
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tbsp red chili powder (adjust based on spice tolerance)
* 1 tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1/2 tsp garam masala powder
* 1 cup yogurt
* 1 cup water or mutton broth
* Salt to taste
* Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional, for garnish)

**Instructions:**

1. **Sear the Mutton:** Heat oil in your Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the mutton and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides (5-7 minutes).

2. **Sauté Aromatics:** Remove mutton and set aside. Sauté onion, garlic, and ginger in remaining oil until onion softens (5 minutes).

3. **Add Spices and Yogurt:** Stir in turmeric, red chili powder, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add yogurt and mix well.

4. **Return and Simmer:** Add browned mutton back with water/broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer with partial lid for 45 minutes, or until tender.

5. **Move to Oven:** Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Transfer Dutch oven with curry and continue cooking for 45-60 minutes, or until thickened and flavors meld.

6. **Finish and Garnish:** Taste and adjust salt. Garnish with cilantro (optional) and serve with rice or flatbreads like naan or roti.
